Months turned into a year. But just as her collection grew, so did her lonliness. A pain as large as her heart lived in her chest. Nothing eased it. Not the Gulls, not a splendid sunset, not the rarest of shells.  *- Where the crawdads sing by Delia Owens*

For a long time, I've felt like a stagnant pool, devoid of ripples, What am I steadfastly holding onto, what am I so fervently clinging to, even I myself do not understand.

I may appear gentle and reserved, silent as a calm, still pool.

But I am more than that—only I comprehend.

Only I know the true fervor and madness, the tumultuous waves roiling within! Like many ordinary, mundane individuals, I harbor both naive ideals and worldly desires—I am never content to settle!


I struggling to connect with my inner self.  Instead, I've magnified feelings of anxiety and helplessness. At times, I've even felt like drifting algae, following wherever the current takes me...

> "I have roots, but I flow." - as Woolf said.

I particularly resonate with Pessoa's description of the self in "The Book of Disquiet," it brings a sense of calm: "I am beginning to grasp the nature of my being. I do not truly exist.I am the chasm between the person I aspire to be and the impression others have crafted of me."
 

 "I am myself, unchanged,
me...!"

"Yes, it is I, the embodiment of my own metamorphosis,
Regardless of what I am, or am not—it all coalesces into my essence.
Irrespective of my yearnings, or lack thereof—it shapes me.
Whether I cherish or disregard—it all stems from the same inner longing."


"I am myself, exhaling deeply..."
Perhaps, I am but a silent stream, flowing gently and steadily...

And finally, a quote from Camus:
*"I, I have no virtues. I have accepted myself. From then on, everything became simple."*
Thankfully, even though I struggle to be loud, I connect with this world through the strokes of my brush and the notes of my music.
