      <description>Months turned into a year. But just as her collection grew, so did her lonliness. A pain as large as her heart lived in her chest. Nothing eased it. Not the Gulls, not a splendid sunset, not the rarest of shells. - Where the crawdads sing by Delia Owens
For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt like a stagnant pool, devoid of ripples, What am I steadfastly holding onto, what am I so fervently clinging to, even I myself do not understand.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Months turned into a year. But just as her collection grew, so did her lonliness. A pain as large as her heart lived in her chest. Nothing eased it. Not the Gulls, not a splendid sunset, not the rarest of shells.  &lt;em&gt;- Where the crawdads sing by Delia Owens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt like a stagnant pool, devoid of ripples, What am I steadfastly holding onto, what am I so fervently clinging to, even I myself do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may appear gentle and reserved, silent as a calm, still pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am more than that—only I comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only I know the true fervor and madness, the tumultuous waves roiling within! Like many ordinary, mundane individuals, I harbor both naive ideals and worldly desires—I am never content to settle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggling to connect with my inner self.  Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ve magnified feelings of anxiety and helplessness. At times, I&amp;rsquo;ve even felt like drifting algae, following wherever the current takes me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have roots, but I flow.&amp;rdquo; - as Woolf said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly resonate with Pessoa&amp;rsquo;s description of the self in &amp;ldquo;The Book of Disquiet,&amp;rdquo; it brings a sense of calm: &amp;ldquo;I am beginning to grasp the nature of my being. I do not truly exist.I am the chasm between the person I aspire to be and the impression others have crafted of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am myself, unchanged,
me&amp;hellip;!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, it is I, the embodiment of my own metamorphosis,
Regardless of what I am, or am not—it all coalesces into my essence.
Irrespective of my yearnings, or lack thereof—it shapes me.
Whether I cherish or disregard—it all stems from the same inner longing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am myself, exhaling deeply&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Perhaps, I am but a silent stream, flowing gently and steadily&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a quote from Camus:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I, I have no virtues. I have accepted myself. From then on, everything became simple.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;
Thankfully, even though I struggle to be loud, I connect with this world through the strokes of my brush and the notes of my music.&lt;/p&gt;
