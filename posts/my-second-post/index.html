        <p>Months turned into a year. But just as her collection grew, so did her lonliness. A pain as large as her heart lived in her chest. Nothing eased it. Not the Gulls, not a splendid sunset, not the rarest of shells.  <em>- Where the crawdads sing by Delia Owens</em></p>
<p>For a long time, I&rsquo;ve felt like a stagnant pool, devoid of ripples, What am I steadfastly holding onto, what am I so fervently clinging to, even I myself do not understand.</p>
<p>I may appear gentle and reserved, silent as a calm, still pool.</p>
<p>But I am more than that—only I comprehend.</p>
<p>Only I know the true fervor and madness, the tumultuous waves roiling within! Like many ordinary, mundane individuals, I harbor both naive ideals and worldly desires—I am never content to settle!</p>
<p>I struggling to connect with my inner self.  Instead, I&rsquo;ve magnified feelings of anxiety and helplessness. At times, I&rsquo;ve even felt like drifting algae, following wherever the current takes me&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have roots, but I flow.&rdquo; - as Woolf said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly resonate with Pessoa&rsquo;s description of the self in &ldquo;The Book of Disquiet,&rdquo; it brings a sense of calm: &ldquo;I am beginning to grasp the nature of my being. I do not truly exist.I am the chasm between the person I aspire to be and the impression others have crafted of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am myself, unchanged,
me&hellip;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is I, the embodiment of my own metamorphosis,
Regardless of what I am, or am not—it all coalesces into my essence.
Irrespective of my yearnings, or lack thereof—it shapes me.
Whether I cherish or disregard—it all stems from the same inner longing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am myself, exhaling deeply&hellip;&rdquo;
Perhaps, I am but a silent stream, flowing gently and steadily&hellip;</p>
<p>And finally, a quote from Camus:
<em>&ldquo;I, I have no virtues. I have accepted myself. From then on, everything became simple.&rdquo;</em>
Thankfully, even though I struggle to be loud, I connect with this world through the strokes of my brush and the notes of my music.</p>
